## Privacy Policy

We have written this privacy policy (version 01.01.1970-121657019) to provide you with information in accordance with the requirements of the [General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679&%3Btid=%5Badsimpletextid]) as well as to explain what information we collect, how we use data and what choices you have as a visitor to this website.

Privacy policies usually sound very technical. However, this version should describe the most important things as simply and clearly as possible. Moreover, technical terms are explained in a reader-friendly manner whenever possible. We would also like to convey that we only collect and use information via this website if there is a corresponding legal basis for it. This is certainly not possible if you give very brief technical explanations, as are often standard on the Internet when it comes to data protection. We hope you find the following explanations interesting and informative. Maybe you will also find some information that you did not know yet.  
Should you still have questions, we kindly ask you to follow the existing links to see further information on third-party websites, or to simply write us an email. You can find our contact information in our website’s imprint.

### Automatic Data Retention

Every time you visit a website nowadays, certain information is automatically created and saved, just as it happens on this website.

Whenever you visit our website such as you are doing right now, our webserver (computer on which this website is saved/stored) automatically saves data such as

*   the address (URL) of the accessed website
*   browser and browser version
*   the used operating system
*   the address (URL) of the previously visited site (referrer URL)
*   the host name and the IP-address of the device the website is accessed from
*   date and time

in files (webserver-logfiles).

Generally, webserver-logfiles stay saved for two weeks and then get deleted automatically. We do not pass this information to others, but we cannot exclude the possibility that this data will be looked at in case of illegal conduct.

### Cookies

Our website uses HTTP-cookies to store user-specific data.  
For your better understanding of the following Privacy Policy statement, we will explain to you below what cookies are and why they are in use.

#### What exactly are cookies?

Every time you surf the internet, you use a browser. Common browsers are for example Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge. Most websites store small text-files in your browser. These files are called cookies.

What should not be dismissed, is that cookies are very useful little helpers. Nearly all websites use cookies. More accurately speaking these are HTTP-cookies, since there are also different cookies for other uses. http-cookies are small files which our website stores on your computer. These cookie files are automatically put into the cookie-folder, which is like the “brain” of your browser. A cookie consists of a name and a value. Moreover, to define a cookie, one or multiple attributes must be specified.

Cookies save certain parts of your user data, such as e.g. language or personal page settings. When you re-open our website, your browser submits these “user specific” information back to our site. Thanks to cookies, our website knows who you are and offers you the settings you are familiar to. In some browsers every cookie has its own file, in others such as Firefox, all cookies are stored in one single file.

There are both first-party cookies and third-party cookies. First-party cookies are created directly by our site, while third-party cookies are created by partner-websites (e.g. Google Analytics). Every cookie is individual, since every cookie stores different data. The expiration time of a cookie also varies – it can be a few minutes, or up to a few years. Cookies are no software-programs and contain no computer viruses, trojans or any other malware. Cookies also cannot access your PC’s information.

This is an example of how cookie-files can look:

**name:** _ga  
**value:** GA1.2.1326744211.152121657019-9  
**purpose:** differentiation between website visitors  
**expiration date:** after 2 years

A browser should support these minimum sizes:

*   at least 4096 bytes per cookie
*   at least 50 cookies per domain
*   at least 3000 cookies in total

#### Which types of cookies are there?

What exact cookies we use, depends on the used services. We will explain this in the following sections of the Privacy Policy statement. Firstly, we will briefly focus on the different types of HTTP-cookies.

There are 4 different types of cookies:

**Essential Cookies  
**These cookies are necessary to ensure the basic function of a website. They are needed when a user for example puts a product into their shopping cart, then continues surfing on different websites and comes back later in order to proceed to the checkout. Even when the user closed their window priorly, these cookies ensure that the shopping cart does not get deleted.

**Purposive Cookies  
**These cookies collect info about the user behaviour and record if the user potentially receives any error messages. Furthermore, these cookies record the website’s loading time as well as its behaviour within different browsers.

**Target-orientated Cookies  
**These cookies care for an improved user-friendliness. Thus, information such as previously entered locations, fonts or data in forms stay saved.

**Advertising Cookies  
**These cookies are also known as targeting-Cookies. They serve the purpose of delivering individually adapted advertisements to the user. This can be very practical, but also rather annoying.

Upon your first visit to a website you are usually asked which of these cookie-types you want to accept. Furthermore, this decision will of course also be saved in a cookie.

#### How can I delete cookies?

You yourself take the decision if and how you want to use cookies. Thus, no matter what service or website cookies are from, you always have the option to delete, deactivate or only partially allow them. Therefore, you can for example block cookies of third parties but allow any other cookies.

If you want change or delete cookie-settings and would like to determine which cookies have been saved to your browser, you can find this info in your browser-settings:

[Chrome: Clear, enable and manage cookies in Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?tid=121657019)

[Safari: Manage cookies and website data in Safari](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/safari/sfri11471/mac?tid=121657019)

[Firefox: Clear cookies and site data in Firefox]( https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/clear-cookies-and-site-data-firefox?tid=121657019)

[Internet Explorer: Delete and manage cookies]( https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies?tid=121657019)

[Microsoft Edge: Delete cookies in Microsoft Edge]( https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4027947/microsoft-edge-delete-cookies?tid=121657019)

If you generally do not want to allow any cookies at all, you can set up your browser in a way, to notify you whenever a potential cookie is about to be set. This gives you the opportunity to manually decide to either permit or deny the placement of every single cookie. The settings for this differ from browser to browser. Therefore, it might be best for you to search for the instructions in Google. If you are using Chrome, you could for example put the search phrase “delete cookies Chrome” or “deactivate cookies Chrome” into Google.

#### How is my data protected?

There is a “cookie policy” that has been in place since 2009\. It states that the storage of cookies requires the user’s consent. However, among the countries of the EU, these guidelines are often met with mixed reactions. In Austria the guidelines have been implemented in § 96 section 3 of the Telecommunications Act (TKG).

If you want to learn more about cookies and do not mind technical documentation, we recommend [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265), the Request for Comments of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) called “HTTP State Management Mechanism”.

### Storage of Personal Data

Any personal data you electronically submit to us on this website, such as your name, email address, home address or other personal information you provide via the transmission of a form or via any comments to the blog, are solely used for the specified purpose and get stored securely along with the respective submission times and IP-address. These data do not get passed on to third parties.

Therefore, we use personal data for the communication with only those users, who have explicitly requested being contacted, as well as for the execution of the services and products offered on this website. We do not pass your personal data to others without your approval, but we cannot exclude the possibility this data will be looked at in case of illegal conduct.

If you send us personal data via email – and thus not via this website – we cannot guarantee any safe transmission or protection of your data. We recommend you, to never send confidential data via email.

### Rights in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation

You are granted the following rights in accordance with the provisions of the [GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/) (General Data Protection Regulation) and the Austrian [Data Protection Act (DSG)](https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokumente/Erv/ERV_1999_1_165/ERV_1999_1_165.html):

*   right to rectification (article 16 GDPR)
*   right to erasure (“right to be forgotten“) (article 17 GDPR)
*   right to restrict processing (article 18 GDPR)
*   righ to notification – notification obligation regarding rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing (article 19 GDPR)
*   right to data portability (article 20 GDPR)
*   Right to object (article 21 GDPR)
*   right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing – including profiling – (article 22 GDPR)

If you think that the processing of your data violates the data protection law, or that your data protection rights have been infringed in any other way, you can lodge a complaint with your respective regulatory authority. For Austria this is the data protection authority, whose website you can access at [https://www.data-protection-authority.gv.at/](https://www.data-protection-authority.gv.at/?tid=121657019).

### Evaluation of Visitor Behaviour

In the following Privacy Policy, we will inform you on if and how we evaluate the data of your visit to this website. The evaluation is generally made anonymously, and we cannot link to you personally based on your behaviour on this website.

You can find out more about how to disagree with the evaluation of visitor data, in the Privacy Policy below.

### TLS encryption with https

We use https to transfer information on the internet in a tap-proof manner (data protection through technology design [Article 25 Section 1 GDPR](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&from=EN&tid=121657019)). With the use of TLS (Transport Layer Security), which is an encryption protocol for safe data transfer on the internet, we can ensure the protection of confidential information. You can recognise the use of this safeguarding tool by the little lock-symbol, which is situated in your browser’s top left corner, as well as by the use of the letters https (instead of http) as a part of our web address.

### Google Analytics Privacy Policy

We use the tracking and analysis tool Google Analytics (GA) of the US-American company Google LLC (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA). Google Analytics collects data on your actions on our website. Whenever you click a link for example, this action is saved in a cookie and transferred to Google Analytics. With the help of reports which we receive from Google Analytics, we can adapt our website and our services better to your wishes. In the following, we will explain the tracking tool in more detail, and most of all, we will inform you what data is saved and how you can prevent this.

#### What is Google Analytics?

Google Analytics is a tracking tool with the purpose of conducting data traffic analysis of our website. For Google Analytics to work, there is a tracking code integrated to our website. Upon your visit to our website, this code records various actions you perform on your website. As soon as you leave our website, this data is sent to the Google Analytics server, where it is stored.

Google processes this data and we then receive reports on your user behaviour. These reports can be one of the following:

*   Target audience reports: With the help of target audience reports we can get to know our users better and can therefore better understand who is interested in our service.
*   Advertising reports: Through advertising reports we can analyse our online advertising better and hence improve it.
*   Acquisition reports: Acquisition reports provide us helpful information on how we can get more people enthusiastic about our service.
*   Behaviour reports: With these reports, we can find out how you interact with our website. By the means of behaviour reports, we can understand what path you go on our website and what links you click.
*   Conversion reports: A conversion is the process of leading you to carry out a desired action due to a marketing message. An example of this would be transforming you from a mere website visitor into a buyer or a newsletter subscriber. Hence, with the help of these reports we can see in more detail, if our marketing measures are successful with you. Our aim is to increase our conversion rate.
*   Real time reports: With the help of these reports we can see in real time, what happens on our website. It makes us for example see, we can see how many users are reading this text right now.

#### Why do we use Google Analytics on our website?

The objective of our website is clear: We want to offer you the best possible service. Google Analytics’ statistics and data help us with reaching this goal.

Statistically evaluated data give us a clear picture of the strengths and weaknesses of our website. On the one hand, we can optimise our page in a way, that makes it easier to be found by interested people on Google. On the other hand, the data helps us to get a better understanding of you as our visitor. Therefore, we can very accurately find out what we must improve on our website, in order to offer you the best possible service. The analysis of that data also enables us to carry out our advertising and marketing measures in a more individual and more cost-effective way. After all, it only makes sense to show our products and services exclusively to people who are interested in them.

#### What data gets stored by Google Analytics?

With the aid of a tracking code, Google Analytics creates a random, unique ID which is connected to your browser cookie. That way, Google Analytics recognises you as a new user. The next time you visit our site, you will be recognised as a “recurring” user. All data that is collected gets saved together with this very user ID. Only this is how it is made possible for us to evaluate and analyse pseudonymous user profiles.

Your interactions on our website are measures by tags such as cookies and app instance IDs. Interactions are all kinds of actions that you perform on our website. If you are also using other Google systems (such as a Google Account), data generated by Google Analytics can be linked with third-party cookies. Google does not pass on any Google Analytics data, unless we as the website owners authorise it. In case it is required by law, exceptions can occur.

The following cookies are used by Google Analytics:

**Name:** _ga  
**Value:**2.1326744211.152121657019-5  
**Purpose:** By deafault, analytics.js uses the cookie _ga, to save the user ID. It generally serves the purpose of differenciating between website visitors.  
**Expiration date:** After 2 years

**Name:** _gid  
**Value:**2.1687193234.152121657019-1

**Value:** 1  
**Purpose:** Just like _gat_gtag_UA_<property-id> this cookie is used for keeping the requirement rate in check.  
**Expiration date:** Afer 10 minutes

**Name:** __utmb  
**Value:**3.10.1564498958  
**Purpose:** This cookie is used to determine new sessions. It is updated every time new data or information gets sent to Google Analytics.  
**Expiration date:** After 30 minutes

**Name:** __utmc  
**Value:** 167421564  
**Purpose:** This cookie is used to determine new sessions for recurring visitors. It is therefore a session cookie, and only stays saved until you close the browser again.  
**Expiration date:** After closing the browser

**Name:** __utmz  
**Value:** m|utmccn=(referral)|utmcmd=referral|utmcct=/  
**Purpose:** This cookie is used to identify the source of our website’s visitor number. This means, that the cookie saves information on where you came to our website from. This could be another site or an advertisement.  
**Expiration date:** After 6 months

**Name:** __utmv  
**Value:** No information  
**Purpose:** The cookie is used to store custom user data. It gets updated whenever information is sent to Google Analytics.  
**Expiration date:** After 2 years

**Note:** This list is by no means exhaustive, since Google are repeatedly changing the use of their cookies.

Below we will give you an overview of the most important data that can be evaluated by Google Analytics:

**Heatmaps:** Google creates so-called Heatmaps an. These Heatmaps make it possible to see the exact areas you click on, so we can get information on what routes you make on our website.

**Session duration:** Google calls the time you spend on our website without leaving it session duration. Whenever you are inactive for 20 minutes, the session ends automatically.

**Bounce rate** If you only look at one page of our website and then leave our website again, it is called a bounce.

**Account creation:** If you create an account or make an order on our website, Google Analytics collects this data.

**IP-Address:** The IP address is only shown in a shortened form, to make it impossible to clearly allocate it.

**Location:** Your approximate location and the country you are in can be defined by the IP address. This process is called IP location determination.

**Technical information:** Information about your browser type, your internet provider and your screen resolution are called technical information.

**Source:** Both, Google Analytics as well as ourselves, are interested what website or what advertisement led you to our site.

Further possibly stored data includes contact data, potential reviews, playing media (e.g. when you play a video on our site), sharing of contents via social media or adding our site to your favourites. This list is not exhaustive and only serves as general guidance on Google Analytics’ data retention.

#### How long and where is the data saved?

Google has servers across the globe. Most of them are in America and therefore your data is mainly saved on American servers. Here you can read detailed information on where Google’s data centres are located: [https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/inside/locations/?hl=en](https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/inside/locations/?hl=en)

Your data is allocated to various physical data mediums. This has the advantage of allowing to retrieve the data faster, and of protecting it better from manipulation. Every Google data centre has respective emergency programs for your data. Hence, in case of a hardware failure at Google or a server error due to natural disasters, the risk for a service interruption stays relatively low.

Google Analytics has a 26 months standardised period of retaining your user data. After this time, your user data is deleted. However, we have the possibility to choose the retention period of user data ourselves. There are the following five options:

*   Deletion after 14 months
*   Deletion after 26 months
*   Deletion after 38 months
*   Deletion after 50 months
*   No automatical deletion

As soon as the chosen period is expired, the data is deleted once a month. This retention period applies to any of your data which is linked to cookies, user identification and advertisement IDs (e.g. cookies of the DoubleClick domain). Any report results are based on aggregated information and are stored independently of any user data. Aggregated information is a merge of individual data into a single and bigger unit.

#### How can I delete my data or prevent data retention?

Under the provisions of the European Union’s data protection law, you have the right to obtain information on your data and to update, delete or restrict it. With the help of a browser add on that can deactivate Google Analytics’ JavaScript (ga.js, analytics.js, dc.js), you can prevent Google Analytics from using your data. You can download this add on at [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB). Please consider that this add on can only deactivate any data collection by Google Analytics.

Should you generally want to deactivate, delete or manage all cookies (independently of Google Analytics), you can use one of the guides that are available for any browser:

[Chrome: Clear, enable and manage cookies in Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?tid=121657019)

[Safari: Manage cookies and website data in Safari](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/safari/sfri11471/mac?tid=121657019)

[Firefox: Clear cookies and site data in Firefox]( https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/clear-cookies-and-site-data-firefox?tid=121657019)

[Internet Explorer: Delete and manage cookies]( https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies?tid=121657019)

[Microsoft Edge: Delete cookies in Microsoft Edge]( https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4027947/microsoft-edge-delete-cookies?tid=121657019)

Google Analytics is an active participant of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, which regulates correct and save transfer of personal data.  
You can find more information on this at [https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&tid=121657019](https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI). We hope we were able to make you more familiar with the most important information on Google Analytics’ data processing. If you want to learn more about the tracking service, we recommend both of the following links: [https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/terms/gb/](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/terms/gb/) and [https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en).

### Google Analytics IP Anonymisation

We implemented Google Analytics’ IP address anonymisation to this website. Google developed this function, so this website can comply with the applicable privacy laws and the local data protection authorities’ recommendations, should they prohibit the retention of any full IP addresses.  
The anonymisation or masking of IP addresses takes place, as soon as they reach Google Analytics’ data collection network, but before the data would be saved or processed.

You can find more information on IP anonymisation at [https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=en](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=en).

### Google Analytics Reports on demographic characteristics and interests

We have turned on Google Analytics’ functions for advertising reports. These reports on demographic characteristics and interests contain details about age, gender and interests. Through them we can get a better picture of our users – without being able to allocate any data to individual persons. You can learn more about advertising functions at [auf https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3450482?hl=en&%3Butm_id=ad](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3450482?hl=en&%3Butm_id=ad).

You can terminate the use of your Google Account’s activities and information in “Ads Settings” at [https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated) via a checkbox.

### MailChimp Privacy Policy

Like many other websites, we use the services of the newsletter company MailChimp on our website. The operator of MailChimp is the company The Rocket Science Group, LLC, 675 Ponce de Leon Ave NE, Suite 5000, Atlanta, GA 30308 USA. With the aid of MailChimp we can easily send you interesting news via newsletter. For the use of the service we do not have to install anything but can still access a pool of very efficient features. In the following we will give more details on this email marketing service and will inform you about the most important data protection aspects.

#### What is MailChimp?

MailChimp is a cloud-based newsletter management service. “Cloud-based“ means that we do not need to install MailChimp on our own computer or server. Instead, we use the service on an external server, or more specifically via an IT infrastructure, which is available via the internet. Using a software this way is also called SaaS (software as a service).

MailChimp allows us to chose from a wide range of different email types. Depending on what goal we want to reach with our newsletter, we can run individual campaigns, regular campaigns, auto responders (automated emails), A/B tests, RSS campaigns (mailings at pre-set times and frequencies) and follow-up campaigns.

#### Why do we use MailChimp on our website?

The reason we would use any newsletter service is so we can stay in contact with you. We want to keep you on the loop what news or attractive offers we have for you at the time. As we constantly seek out the easiest and best solutions for our marketing measures, we have decided on MailChimp as our newsletter management service. While the software is very easy to use, it offers many helpful features. For example, it allows us to create interesting and attractive newsletters in only a short time. With integrated design templates we can create every newsletter in an individual way. Due to the “responsive design” feature, our contents are also presented in a readable and pleasant way on your smartphone (or any other mobile device).

With tools such as A/B testing or the extensive analysis options, we can swiftly tell how you like our newsletters. This means that we can react if necessary and improve our offer or our services.

Another advantage is MailChimp’s “cloud system”. The data is not stored and processed directly on our server. We can retrieve the datafrom external servers and therefore save our memory space and also decrease maintenance effort.

#### What data is saved by MailChimp?

Rocket Science Group LLC (MailChimp) operate online platforms which enable us to get in contact with you, provided you subscribed to our newsletter. If you become a subscriber of our newsletter via our website, by email you agree to become a member of a MailChimp email list. Then, MailChimp saves your subscription data and your IP address, so it can verify your entry into the list provider. Moreover, MailChimp stores your email address, your name, your physical address and demographic information, such as language or location.

This information is used to send emails to you and to allow certain other MailChimp functions (e.g. the evaluation of newsletters).

MailChimp also shares information with third parties to improve its services. Moreover, MailChimp shares certain data with advertising partners of third parties to get a better understanding of its clients’ interests, in order to provide relevant contents and target-oriented advertising.

With so-called “web beacons” (small graphics in HTML emails), MailChimp can determine if an email has arrived, has been opened or if links have been clicked. This information is then stored on MailChimp’s servers. That way we receive statistical evaluations and can see how you liked our newsletter. Therefore, we can tailor our offer better to your wishes and improve our service.

Moreover, MailChimp are allowed to use this data for improving their own service. Thus, they can for example technically optimise the distribution or determine the location (or the country) of the recipient.

The following cookies can be set by MailChimp. The list is not exhaustive and is merely an exemplary selection:

**Name**: AVESTA_ENVIRONMENT  
**Value:** Prod  
**Purpose:** This cookie is necessary to provide the services of Mailchimp. It is always set when a user registers for a newsletter mailing list.  
**Expiry date:** at the end of the session

**Name**: ak_bmsc  
**Value:** F1766FA98C9BB9DE4A39F70A9E5EEAB55F6517348A7000001121657019-3  
**Purpose:** The cookie is used to differentiate a human from a bot. That way secure reports on the use of a website can be created.  
**Expiry date:** after 2 hours

**Name**: bm_sv  
**Value:** A5A322305B4401C2451FC22FFF547486~FEsKGvX8eovCwTeFTzb8//I3ak2Au…  
**Purpose:** This cookie comes from MasterPass Digital Wallet (a MasterCard service) and is used to offer a secure and easy virtual payment process to visitors. For this purpose, the user is anonymously identified on the website.  
**Expiry date:** after 2 hours

**Name**: _abck  
**Value:** 8D545C8CCA4C3A50579014C449B045121657019-9  
**Purpose:** We could not find any further information about the purpose of this cookie.  
**Expiry date:** after one year

For better display it could be that you would sometimes open our newsletter via a specified link. This can be the case if your email program does not work or if the newsletter is not displayed properly. The newsletter will then be shown via a MailChimp website. MailChimp also uses cookies on its websites (small text files which save data on your browser).  
Personal data can be processed by MailChimp and their partners (e.g. Google Analytics). MailChimp is responsible for the collection of this data and we have no influence on it. MailChimp’s “Cookie Statement” (at: [https://mailchimp.com/legal/cookies/](https://mailchimp.com/legal/cookies/)) tells you exactly how and why the company uses cookies.

#### How long and where is the data saved?

Since MailChimp is an American company, all retained data is stored on American servers.

Generally, the data stays permanently saved on MailChimp’s servers and is deleted only when you request it. You can have your contact information with us deleted. This permanently removes all your personal data for us and anonymises you in MailChimp’s reports. However, you can also request the deletion of your data permanently at MailChimp. Then all your data are removed from there and we receive a notification from MailChimp. After we receive the email we have 30 days to delete your contact from all integrations.

#### How can I delete my data or prevent data retention?

You can withdraw your approval for the receipt of our newsletters anytime, by clicking the link in the lower area of the received newsletter email. When you click on the unsubscribe link, your data with MailChimp gets deleted.

When you land on a MailChimp website via a link in our newsletter and cookies are consequently set in your browser, you can delete or deactivate these cookies anytime.

Depending on the browser, the deactivation or deletion differs slightly. The following instructions show how to manage cookies in your browser:
